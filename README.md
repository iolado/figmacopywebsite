This project is a landing page for a personal portfolio that was created by combining HTML and CSS to turn a Figma design into a fully functional website. The project's objective was to replicate the original design's layout and visual style while rebranding it with unique content, such as a call-to-action button, hero section, navigation, social media icons, and a highlighted "worked with" area. To make a polished first impression, the page highlights strong visual hierarchy, crisp typography, and a contemporary dark theme.

A floating, glass-style navigation bar with blur effects, interactive hover states, unique image-based social media icons, and a flexible layout that adjusts to various screen sizes are among the extra features that were included to improve usability and visual quality. To closely resemble the original design while enhancing readability and consistency, subtle shadows, gradients, and spacing modifications were used. This project shows proficiency in responsiveness, layout structure, styling, and converting design ideas into clear, manageable code.
